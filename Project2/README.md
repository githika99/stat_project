# Distributions of Each Variable


Private prisons have less Direct and Indirect Annual Per Capita Cost
than State prisons. Direct Costs are tied to the operation of a specific
prison facility or unit. They include salaries for staff; food,
clothing, and hygiene products for inmates; utilities (electricity,
water, etc.) used in the facility; and facility maintenance. Indirect
costs are shared or overhead costs that support the prison system but
arenâ€™t directly linked to one facility. They include central
administration salaries (e.g., the state corrections department
headquarters); IT systems that serve multiple facilities; legal services
and oversight; state-level contracting or procurement services; and
training programs for correctional officers across facilities.
