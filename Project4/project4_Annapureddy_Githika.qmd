### **1. Scientific or Statistical Question**

-   Question: How do private prisons and state prisons spend money differently? Does this uncover any underlying patterns amongst private or state prisons?

### **2. Data**

-   Data generating model: Features in data: Prison Unit ADP UNIT_DIRECT COMPLEX_DIRECT TOTAL_DIRECT TOTAL_INDIRECT TOTAL_EXPENSE Annual Per Capita Cost - Direct Annual Per Capita Cost - Indirect Annual Per Capita Cost - Total Daily Per Capita Cost

-   Some of these features can be calculated from others. So if we simulate ADP, UNIT_DIRECT, COMPLEX_DIRECT, and TOTAL_DIRECT we can calculate the rest of the values.

-   These are the calculated features: TOTAL_DIRECT = UNIT_DIRECT + COMPLEX_DIRECT, TOTAL_EXPENSE = TOTAL_DIRECT + TOTAL_INDIRECT, `Annual Per Capita Cost - Direct` = `TOTAL_DIRECT / ADP, Annual Per Capita Cost - Indirect` = `TOTAL_INDIRECT / ADP, Annual Per Capita Cost - Total` = `TOTAL_EXPENSE / ADP, Daily Per Capita Cost` = `Annual Per Capita Cost - Total / 365`

-   Data-generating model: Let i=1,2,…,ni = 1, 2, \dots, ni=1,2,…,n index each prison unit.

    -   ADPi​∼UniformDiscrete(200,1300). We assume ADP follows a discrete uniform distribution between 200 and 1300.

    -   UNIT_DIRECTi​=ADPi​⋅Ui​,Ui​∼N(15,000,3,0002) COMPLEX_DIRECTi=ADPi⋅Ci,Ci∼N(6,000,1,5002)\text{COMPLEX\_DIRECT}\_i = \text{ADP}\_i \cdot C_i, \quad C_i \sim \mathcal{N}(6{,}000, 1{,}500\^2)COMPLEX_DIRECTi​=ADPi​⋅Ci​,Ci​∼N(6,000,1,5002) Direct costs are modeled as **proportional to population** with normally distributed per capita costs.

    -   TOTAL_INDIRECTi​=ADPi​⋅Ii​,Ii​∼N(1,500,5002)

    -   Derived Values: Formulas are found above.

### **3. Estimates**

-   What quantity or quantities are you estimating via simulation? i.e. what is your response variable(s)?

-   Use clear mathematical notation to define what you are calculating. Some ideas: bias, variance, power, MSE, deviance, etc.).
