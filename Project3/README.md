# Model


In order to analyze the difference between private and public prisons, I
will use Principle Component Analysis. After reducing dimensionality
with PCA, I created a plot in which private and public prisons are
colored differently. I then used hierarchical clustering to see if these
prisons cluster differently. I found that â€¦

I also conducted regression to quantify how prison type effects cost
metrics. I controlled for number of prisoners by only looking at the per
capita measures. Additionally, I controlled for custody by only
selecting minimum and medium prisons, since there is no data for close
custody or max custody private prisons.

I used \_\_\_ regression because \_\_\_. The residuals of the model were
\_\_\_ normal, as displayed in this plot.
