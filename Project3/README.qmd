In order to analyze the difference between private and public prisons, I used Principle Component Analysis. After reducing dimensionality with PCA, I created a plot in which private and public prisons are colored differently.

**Analysis**

**PCA**

The PCA Graph shows that State prisons are more consistent in how they operate per inmate and Private prisons are more varied and some diverge significantly from the state cluster. The difference is not significant enough to determine that all private prisons are different from all state prisons.

The scree plot for private prisons shows that PCA1 and PCA2 have non-zero variances. This implies PCA found two patterns in the data.

The scree plot for state prisons shows that only PCA1 has a non-zero variance. This implies PCA found only one pattern in the data.

These are the features in the PCA components:

PC1 (State) and PC1 (Private):

Annual Per Capita Cost - Total

Daily Per Capita Cost

Annual Per Capita Cost - Direct

Annual Per Capita Cost - Indirect

PC2 (Private):

Annual Per Capita Cost - Indirect

Annual Per Capita Cost - Direct

Daily Per Capita Cost

Annual Per Capita Cost - Total

This suggests that Annual Per Capita Cost - Indirect is relevant to Private Prisons but not State Prisons.

**Regression**

I conducted regression to quantify how prison type and ADP effects cost metrics. I controlled for number of prisoners by only looking at the per capita measures.

**Combined Regression**

I combined both Private and State datasets. I addeed a feature called 'Type' that was set to either Private or State. Two different regression models aimed to identify whether a prison was private or state based on the Annual Per Capita Cost - Direct or Annual Per Capita Cost - Indirect .This code is seen in Combined_Regression.R.

The model likely overfit due to small amount of data. However, it picked up on general trend, higher per capita costs are incurred by state prisons. 

**Individual Regression**

I also conducted linear regression on state data and private data separately. The regression predicted how Annual Per Capita Cost - Direct and Annual Per Capita Cost - Total are predicted by ADP. This code is seen in Individual_Regression.R.

For Private, there is no clear trend. For State, the per capita costs go down as ADP increases. This suggests economies of scale — larger prisons can spread out fixed costs more effectively 

However, there were only 11 data points for Private data and 64 data points for State data, this was not enough to accurately do regression.

**Residuals (top left)**

-   Non-randomness suggests heteroscedasticity

**Q-Q Plot (top right)**

-   Diagonal means normal distribution

**Scale-Location Plot (bottom left)**

-   Non-flat suggests heteroscedasticity. This suggests that linear regression is not appropriate in this case.

**Residuals vs. Leverage (bottom right)**

-   Inflection points suggest one point has high influence

**Residuals (top left)**

-   Non-randomness suggests a linear relationship may not accurately capture relationship

**Q-Q Plot (top right)**

-   Diagonal means normal distribution

**Scale-Location Plot (bottom left)**

-   Flat suggests constant variance. The relatively flat line suggests that linear regression is much more appropriate for state data, likely because it has more data.

**Residuals vs. Leverage (bottom right)**

-   Inflection points suggest one point has high influence
