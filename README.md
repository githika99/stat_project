   **Research Question & Motivation:**  

    I want to explore how prisons in the U.S. generate and spend money,
    and how financial decisions differ by custody level, ownership, and
    inmate population. Inspired by the work of the Prison Policy
    Initiative, my goal is to understand how economic structures shape
    incarceration practices and whether funding aligns with
    rehabilitation.

  **Hypotheses:**  

    I hypothesize that private prisons spend less per inmate than
    state-run facilities and that higher inmate populations correlate
    with lower per-capita spending. I also expect that funding for
    community-based alternatives like parole is comparatively low.

  **Data:**
    
    I have two datasets from Arizona Department of Corrections.
    They are as follows: [Arizona Department of Corrections- Cost
    Report](https://corrections.az.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/adcrr-percapcostreport_fy2020-final.pdf) and
    [Arizona Department of Corrections - Inmate Fact
    Sheet](https://corrections.az.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/InmateFactSheet/Inmate_Fact_Sheet_FY_2020_Normalized.pdf).
    The data is reported by Arizona Departmnet of Corrections, one
    private prison. The data contains tables on many different topics. I
    am most interested in the “Daily custody level expenditure detail by
    object” table. Other relevant tables include “State Prison Costs by
    Custody Level”, “Contracted Prison Bed Costs by Custody Level”, and
    “County Jails (Inmates Pending Transfer to State Custody)”.
